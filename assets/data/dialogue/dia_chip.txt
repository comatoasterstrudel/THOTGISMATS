For the growth of social media-- I don't exactly know as a teen who spent a majority of his life offline.:0.03:c_thinkclosed:chip:left:
But for what I've seen, it can be okay at times. But I do not recommend it for anyone who is very...Sensitive to mean comments, graphics, and stuff?:0.03:c_thinkopen:chip:left:
Just not for children, and alot of teens.:0.03:c_thinkclosed:chip:left:
Not saying that alot of social medias is filled with toxicity and stupidity, but there are alot you should avoid for it.:0.03:c_thinkopen:chip:left:
Twitter at the definite top for that, it is an absolute cesspit of toxic waste.:0.03:c_thinkclosed:chip:left:
But there are the occasional people you can meet and start a bond with, I met Coma for goodness' sake.:0.02:c_left:chip:left:

But people can be a little unlucky in social interaction; A lot of people are known to pressure, dump, and just generally act unfair because they're on the other sign of a screen.:0.02:c_thinkclosed:chip:left:
But in the bad, there's always good.:0.035:c_neutral:chip:left:
I've met alot of great people online and alot of fun things to do on Social Media and the internet, you just gotta look in the right places..:0.02:c_right:chip:left:
But if you wanna say things like YouTube are social medias as well. Then not everything has to be bad--:0.025:c_left:chip:left:
But that's all I have to say for now.:0.035:c_neutral:chip:left:
